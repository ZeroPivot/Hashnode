## Nginx and Ruby3/Puma with Sinatra

Just some quick notes on how to use nginx with Ruby/Puma, and SSL, after spending an entire day debugging.
***

Here is what I am currently using:

**Ruby 3.0.0** on **WSL2** with **Ubuntu 20.04LTS**; the app get pushed to servers on digitalocean.com, using the same distro now, and was the reason I wrote this little journal.   

***
Given that you are already using Rails or Sinatra with Ruby 3.0.0, preferably on the latest distribution of Ubuntu

`service nginx start` to see if NGINX is working correctly

`service nginx restart`

If not: 

`sudo apt install nginx`

***
Here is my file for NGINX, it goes in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:

```
user root;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;

events {
	worker_connections 768;
	#multi_accept on;
}

http {

upstream app { server unix://root/comicman-remote-modular/config/puma.sock; }

server {

	server_name domain.net www.domain.net;
        root /root/app_location/public;
	location / {
		proxy_pass http://app;
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		proxy_set_header X-Forwaeded-Host 'domain.net';
		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
	}

	##

	include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
	include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;

server {
        listen 80;
	listen [::]:80;
	         
	server_name domain.net www.domain.net;
        }
}
```


*This nginx file for the puma proxy requires modification.*
***

Also, comment out everything in the files in `/etc/nginx/sites-available`, or it will try defaulting to their html pages. 

Then, in `/usr/local/nginx/html`, delete everything; you don't need html pages to send instead of the Proxy. 

***
If you want SSL, follow the directions at: https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntufocal-apache -- Let's Encrypt and Certbot will automate updating and providing you with SSL certificates.

More to come, mostly updates.
